        <h1>Anthony Santelices</h1>

            <p>This website will be used as a journal of sorts to keep track of my climbing activites at the <em>Outdoor Advdentures</em> Climbing Wall.</p>
            <p>There are several sections on this page. One talks about the differences in climbing types. One talks about the difficulties and grades of climbing. The last will be a log of all 
                the routes, or problems, as they are called in the climbing community, that I complete.</p>

        <h2>Bouldering versus other types of climbing</h2>

            <p>At the <em>Outdoor Adventures</em> space on campus, there is a bouldering wall available free to students, and to faculty for a small fee.</p>

            <p>
                Bouldering differes from other kinds of climbing in that there is no harness around your body and there are no ropes to catch you if you fall.
                Because of this, bouldering is typically done, well, on boulders, big rocks. Bouldering can be done both inside and outside. Outside bouldering tries to mitigate possible harm
                by having a safety mat under you while you climb. This mat has some foam cushion and is a only a few inches thick as a lot of outdoor boulding spots require a short hike 
                through the wilderness. You don't want to be luggin around a 30 pound mat of foam to and from your climbing site.
            </p>

            <p>
                On campus we only have indoor bouldering. This consists of a tall and very wide wall of 14 ft. and 60 ft. respectively. Indoor bouldering differs from outdoor in that the foam 
                mat to catch you is much thicker, cushioning your fall more, and the problems on the wall can be changed any day of the week. The student employees of the climbing wall have 
                specific people called "setters". They create the different problems on the wall. The routes are changed on a bi-weekly basis. Each bi-week, only two colors are changed.
            </p>

        <h2>Climbing Difficulties and Grades</h2>

            <p>Each climbing gym has its own color code to signify the difficulty of each route. The climbing wall on campus uses the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Beginner - Green</li>
                <li>Easy - Yellow</li>
                <li>Lower Intermediate - Orange</li>
                <li>Upper Intermediate - Blue</li>
                <li>Advanced - Black</li>
                <li>Expert - White</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Though the colors define a range of diffculty, there are ranges of diffculty for each color. This range is from VB to V17 or even more depending on who you talk to, VB stands 
                for V-Beginner. This V-Scale is what is used for outdoor bouldering, as there are no different colored holds to signify difficulty.
